//Q: Where should you use a semicolon and where you shouldn't?
//A: You should use a semicolon after every statement. But, if you don't use it, JavaScript will automatically add it for you. But, it's a good practice to use it. Also, there are some cases where JavaScript won't add a semicolon for you. For example, if you have two statements on the same line, JavaScript won't add a semicolon between them. So, it's better to add it yourself. Also, if you are using ES6 modules, you don't need to add a semicolon after every statement. But, if you are not using ES6 modules, you should add a semicolon after every statement.
