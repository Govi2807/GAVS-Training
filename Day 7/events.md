# JavaScript Event Handling

## Event Handling

Event handling is the process of capturing an event, processing it, and responding to it. In JavaScript, events are handled through event handlers. An event handler is a function that is called when an event occurs. Event handlers are also called event listeners.

## Event Listeners

Event listeners are functions that listen for an event to occur and then execute some code in response to the event. Event listeners are added to elements using the `addEventListener()` method. The `addEventListener()` method takes two arguments: the event to listen for and the function to execute when the event occurs.

```js
element.addEventListener(event, function);
```

## Event Object

When an event occurs, the browser creates an event object. The event object contains information about the event and the element on which the event occurred. The event object is passed as an argument to the event handler function.

## Event Propagation

Event propagation is the process of capturing and processing an event. Event propagation occurs in two phases: capturing and bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event is captured by the outermost element and propagated to the innermost element. In the bubbling phase, the event is captured by the innermost element and propagated to the outermost element.

## Event Bubbling


Event bubbling is the process of capturing and processing an event. Event bubbling occurs in two phases: capturing and bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event is captured by the outermost element and propagated to the innermost element. In the bubbling phase, the event is captured by the innermost element and propagated to the outermost element.

## Event Capturing

Event capturing is the process of capturing and processing an event. Event capturing occurs in two phases: capturing and bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event is captured by the outermost element and propagated to the innermost element. In the bubbling phase, the event is captured by the innermost element and propagated to the outermost element.

## Event Delegation

Event delegation is the process of capturing and processing an event. Event delegation occurs in two phases: capturing and bubbling. In the capturing phase, the event is captured by the outermost element and propagated to the innermost element. In the bubbling phase, the event is captured by the innermost element and propagated to the outermost element.


## Examples

### Example 1: Event Listener

```js
// Get the button element
const button = document.querySelector('button');

// Add an event listener to the button element
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // Display a message
  alert('The button was clicked!');
});
```

### Example 2: Event Object

```js
// Get the button element
const button = document.querySelector('button');

// Add an event listener to the button element
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // Display the event object
  console.log(event);
});
```
