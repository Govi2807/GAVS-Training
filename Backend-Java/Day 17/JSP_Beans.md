# JSP Beans

## 1. What is a Bean?

A Java Bean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. Beans can be combined to create an application. A Java Bean is a Java class that should follow following conventions:

- It should have a no-arg constructor.
- It should be Serializable.
- It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties, known as getter and setter methods.
- It should provide a public default constructor.
- It should not contain any argument constructor.
- It should not define the `finalize()` method.
- It should implement `Serializable` interface.
- It should have a public no-arg constructor.
- It should have private instance variables.
- It should have public getter and setter methods.
- It should not have any public method that takes `java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent` as an argument. These methods are used by the introspection mechanism and it allows the tool to register interest in changes of the property.
- It should not have any public method that takes `java.beans.VetoableChangeEvent` as an argument. These methods are used by the introspection mechanism and it allows the tool to register interest in changes of the property.
- It should not have any inner classes, interfaces, or enumerations.
- It should not be a `java.awt.Component`.
- It should not implement `Cloneable` interface.
- It should not implement `java.io.Externalizable` interface.
- It should not contain static methods.
- It should not contain static fields.
- It should not contain any final fields.

## 2. Advantages of Java Bean

The advantages of Java Bean are as follows:

- It provides easy maintenance.
- It provides easy integration.
- It provides easy understandability due to its naming convention.
- It provides easy extensibility because of its inheritance nature.
- It provides support for customization.
- It provides support for events.
- It provides support for persistence.
- It provides support for properties.
- It provides support for introspection.

## 3. Java Bean Properties

A Java Bean property is a named attribute that can be accessed by the user of the bean. It may be read, write, or both. It may be bound, constrained, or both.

### 3.1. Bound Property

A bound property is a property that fires a `PropertyChangeEvent` when its value is changed. The `PropertyChangeEvent` object contains the old and new values for the property. The `PropertyChangeEvent` object is passed as a parameter to the `PropertyChangeListener` object's `propertyChange()` method.

### 3.2. Constrained Property

A constrained property is a property that fires a `VetoableChangeEvent` when its value is changed. The `VetoableChangeEvent` object contains the old and new values for the property. The `VetoableChangeEvent` object is passed as a parameter to the `VetoableChangeListener` object's `vetoableChange()` method.

### 3.3. Read-Only Property

A read-only property is a property that can be read but not changed. It provides only a getter method.

### 3.4. Write-Only Property

A write-only property is a property that can be changed but not read. It provides only a setter method.


## 4. Java Bean Events

A Java Bean event is an action that occurs on a Java Bean. It is generated by the source object and sent to all registered listener objects. The source object is an object on which an event occurs and the listener object is an object which is notified when an event occurs. The listener object has two major requirements. First, it must have been registered with one or more source objects to receive notifications about specific types of events. Second, it must implement methods to receive and process these notifications.


## 5. Java Bean Persistence

Java Bean persistence is a mechanism that allows the values of an object's variables to be stored and retrieved. It is also known as serialization. The Java Bean persistence mechanism is used to store the state of an object. The state of an object means the values of an object's variables.
