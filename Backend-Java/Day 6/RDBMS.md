# What is RDBMS?
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. 
- A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.

# What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard

# What Can SQL do?
- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve, insert, update, delete data from a database
- SQL can create new databases

# Databases in RDBMS
- A database is a collection of tables, with related data.
- A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management.
- The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
- By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.
- For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book, or you may have stored the data in a computerized database. A computerized database management system is a software system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.

# What is a Database Management System?
- A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database.
- The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications.
- A DBMS is typically shared among many users. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use in retrieving and storing database information.
- Database applications are designed to support the business functions associated with the processing of data.
- A database management system provides three views of the database data:
    - The external level defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database.
    - The conceptual level describes the structure of the whole database for a group of end-users.
    - The internal level describes how the data is actually stored in the database.
    - The internal level is sometimes called the physical level.
    - The external and conceptual levels are sometimes called the logical level.
    - The internal level is sometimes called the physical level.

# What is a Database?
- A database is a collection of related data.
- A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe of discourse (UoD).
- Changes to miniworld structures are reflected in the database.
- A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.
- A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.
- It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.
- A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe of discourse (UoD).

# What is a Database System?
- The database and DBMS software together is called as Database system.

# What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
- A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures.
- It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database.
- The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data.

# What is a Database Instance?
- A database instance (or DBMS instance) refers to the state or snapshot of a database at any given time.
- It is a set of memory structures that manage database files.
- A database instance is created when an instance of the database software is started.
- When the database is running and is available for user access, then it is said to be in the active state.

# What is a Database Schema?
- A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database.
- It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated.
- It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.
- A database schema defines its entities and the relationship among them.
- It contains a descriptive detail of the database, which can be depicted by means of schema diagrams.
- It's also called the intension of the database.
- It is specified during database design and is not expected to change frequently.
- It is sometimes also called database state, which is the actual data stored in a database at a particular moment.

# What is a Database Model?
- A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated.
- The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format.
- Common logical data models for databases include:
    - Hierarchical database model
    - Network model
    - Relational model
    - Entity-relationship model
    - Document model
    - Entity-attribute-value model
    - Star schema
    - Multidimensional model
    - Flat model
    - Object model
