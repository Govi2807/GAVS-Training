# MVC Architecture
- MVC stands for Model View Controller.
- It is a software design pattern for developing web applications.
- It is a way of structuring the code of your application.
- It is a way of organizing your code into three separate but interconnected parts.
- It is a way of separating the logic and data of your application from the way it is presented to the user.
  
## Model
- The model is responsible for managing the data of the application.
- It responds to the request from the view and to the instructions from the controller to update itself.
- It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
- It contains the basic functionalities of the application.
- It can have logic to update controller if its state changes.
- It can have logic to retrieve data from a database.
- It can have logic to validate data.

## View
- The view is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
- It is the presentation layer of the application.
- It is the topmost layer of the pattern responsible for displaying the data.
- It is a passive interface that displays data and that's it.
- It has no knowledge of the model.
- It can have logic to decide how to display the model data.
- It can have logic to format the data before displaying it.
- It can have logic to allow the user to interact with the model data.
- It can have logic to send user actions to the controller.
- It can have logic to update the controller if the user interacts with the view.

## Controller
- The controller is responsible for responding to the user input and perform interactions on the data model objects.
- It is the connection between the model and the view.
- It is the middle layer of the pattern responsible for controlling the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes.
- It is responsible for updating the model when the user manipulates the view.
- It is responsible for updating the view whenever data changes.
- It can have logic to update the model if the user manipulates the view.
- It can have logic to update the view whenever data changes.
- It can have logic to decide which view to display when the user interacts with the view.
- It can have logic to decide which model method to call when the user interacts with the view.
- It can have logic to decide which view to display when the model changes.
- It can have logic to decide which model method to call when the model changes.

## Advantages of MVC Architecture
- It provides a clean separation of concerns between the models, views, and controllers within an application.
- It provides a better support for test-driven development (TDD).
- It provides a better support for multiple views.
- It provides a better support for asynchronous technique.
- It provides a better support for web development.

## Disadvantages of MVC Architecture
- It is complex to implement.
- It is complex to understand.
- It is complex to maintain.
- It is complex to test.
- It is complex to debug.
- It is complex to deploy.
- It is complex to reuse.
- It is complex to learn.
- It is complex to develop.
  
## MVC Architecture in MERN Stack
- MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node.
- It is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.
- It is based on MVC architecture.
- It is a combination of the following four technologies:
  - MongoDB: A document-based open-source database.
  - Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - React: A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the server.
  - It is a combination of the following three layers:
    - Model: MongoDB
    - View: React
    - Controller: Express and Node.js
