# Angular Forms

Angular provides two approaches to handle the user input through forms: reactive and template-driven. Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes. Both give you control over how to present the form to the user and how to collect the data from the user. 

## Validation

Angular provides two ways to validate form input: reactive and template-driven. Both ways use directives to define the validation rules in the template and to provide feedback to the user. Both ways use the same validation directives, include `ngModel` and `ngModelGroup`, and provide the same validation functionality.

# Template driven forms
- Template driven forms are the forms that are created using the template driven approach.
- In this approach, we create the form using the template and then we add the validation and other features to the form controls using the directives.
- The template driven forms are easy to use and are suitable for simple scenarios.
- The template driven forms are suitable for the scenarios where we need to create a form with less number of form controls.


# Reactive forms
- Reactive forms are the forms that are created using the reactive approach.
- In this approach, we create the form programmatically and then we add the validation and other features to the form controls using the code.
- The reactive forms are complex to use and are suitable for complex scenarios.
- The reactive forms are suitable for the scenarios where we need to create a form with more number of form controls.
- The reactive forms are also known as the model-driven forms because we create the form model programmatically and then we bind the form controls to the form model.
