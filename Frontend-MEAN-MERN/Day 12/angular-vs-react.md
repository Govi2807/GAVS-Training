# Angular vs React

## Angular
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.

## React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single page applications. React allows us to create reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and it has strong foundation and large community behind it. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
