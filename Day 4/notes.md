## CSS Transformations

CSS transformations allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements. The transform property is used to specify the transformation functions to be applied to an element. The transform property can be applied to all elements, but it only has an effect on elements that have a defined width, height, or border. The transform property is supported in IE10+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

## Types of CSS Transformations

<!-- point wise short explanation -->

- 2D Transformations

## 3D Transformations

<!-- point wise short explanation -->

- 3D Rotate

- 3D SkewG

### Gradient

Gradient is a smooth transition between two or more colors. CSS defines two types of gradients:

- Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
- Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
- Conic Gradients (defined by their center as well as the angle)
- Repeating Gradients (repeats the gradient pattern)
- Multiple Gradients (sets multiple gradients)
- Gradient Angles (defines the direction of the gradient)
- Gradient Color Stops (defines the position of colors in a gradient)
- Gradient Repeating Angles (defines the repeating direction of a gradient)
- Gradient Repeating Color Stops (defines the repeating position of colors in a gradient)
- Gradient Shapes (defines the shape of a gradient)
- Gradient Sizes (defines the size of a gradient)
- Gradient Positions (defines the position of a gradient)
- Gradient Images (defines an image as a gradient)
- Gradient Borders (defines a gradient border)
- Gradient Text (defines gradient text)
- Gradient Backgrounds (defines gradient backgrounds)
- Gradient Textures (defines gradient textures)
- Gradient with Background Image (defines gradient with background image)
