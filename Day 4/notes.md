## CSS Transformations

CSS transformations allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements. The transform property is used to specify the transformation functions to be applied to an element. The transform property can be applied to all elements, but it only has an effect on elements that have a defined width, height, or border. The transform property is supported in IE10+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
